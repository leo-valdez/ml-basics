# ml-basics
<h2>INFORMATION</h2>
This repository contains the following code:

1) Code based on Sklearn,matplotlib to display graphically the number nearest to the input number(ml_firstcode.py)

2) Code based on speech recognation to recognize speech and open application firefox in this particular code(textspeech.py
  
       This can be used to make your own working jarvis by:
       1) Making list variable for storing application and other functionality keywords(like in this case 'Firefox') .
       2) Taking speech as an input.
       3) Converting it into text.
       4) Mapping values of text and list variable. 
       5) If matched perform the specific function.
       6) You can convert this into a batch file and run this code in backend by connecting it to any start up application of your PC.
       7) Make a keyword particular to allow the code to run(like in case of siri or cortana others we say 'hi','okay',etc.) and stop after   
          the command is executed. 

3) Code based on linear regression(using pytorch,matplotlib) to train,predict y=2x+1 and plot graph.(linerRegg.py)

4) Code used to show example of simple perceptron model.(perceptron_tech.py)

<h1>Future Work:</h1>
This repository will be updated as soon as I do new basic codes.
